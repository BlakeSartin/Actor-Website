# Description
This is a website designed to be used by actors to display current, past, and future accomplishments, as well as relevant news, pictures, reels, and contact information. This website is a demo, and should only be used for proof of concept. Each component has been designed to allow an actor to display a differnet part of their career. A simple and sleek topbar allows for easy navigation. Hopefully this demo will become a fully realized website in the future!
